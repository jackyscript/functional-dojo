Playing with functional programming

## What is it?
functional-dojo is a playground for functional programming experiments. It currently contains example programs written in:

* Javascript
* Java

The purpose is to share tips, hints and tidbits about functional programming in a simple executable manner, as I want to give back to fellow programmers.

## Prerequisites:

* No further pre steps necessary for js
* maven for Java

```
git clone https://github.com/jackyscript/functional-dojo.git
cd java/demo
```

#### Maven
```
mvn clean install
```
